<h1>What do I do Outside of School?</h1>
<p>    One of my favorite things to do is play on my Playstation 3. I have it modded with 4.72 CFW, and spoofed to the latest version. I enjoy playing roms
  <br> from all systems, but lately i've been more into PS3 titles. Some of my favorite games are Modern Warfare 3 from the Call of Duty series, Beyond: Two
  <br> Souls, and some of the Ratchet and Clank games. I enjoy working on consoles as well. I bought my launch model because it was fully backwards compatible
  <br> and it was listed as broken, for $20. Now, it reads games and the highest the CELL/RSX will go is 50°C.
