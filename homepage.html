<p>     This is a website I made my senior year of High School. It was an assignment, In class we learned to code and how to use atom.
  <br>  On this site, you’ll find pictures of me, my family, and other things I've learned how to do. Feel free to have a look around.
  <br> This was my first website assignment for the 2019-2020 school year. I plan to improve my work as the year goes on!
